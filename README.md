# Balance the Ball

"Balance the Ball" is a 3d puzzle game, inspried by Ballance Video. The player controls a ball via mouse and keyboard, moving it along a course while trying not to fall off the screen.



## Gameplay

In the game, the player can change the ball's material with special transformers throughout the game levels . It can be transformed into a wood, stone, or paper ball.

The wooden ball is very stable and can be used for several puzzles in the game. The stone ball is extremely heavy, and hard to control compare to other two transformations, but this ball can easily push down boxes and any path-blockers. The paper ball is very light and easy to control with high speed compare to other two. A paper ball can be blown into the air by ventilators and can roll up steep hills easily.
